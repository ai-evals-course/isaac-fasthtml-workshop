# Primary Libraries

# Rules

- Use best practices for FastAPI.
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
- Prefer async functions for all I/O operations.
- Use type hints for all function signatures.
- Use Pydantic v2 models for input validation and response schemas.
- Implement sqlite3 and properly escaped SQL for CRUD operations
- Use Ruff for linting and formatting Python code.
