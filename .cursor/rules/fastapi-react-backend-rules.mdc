This project should use the modern, concise, and best practices for building Python 3.11+ applications

# Primary Libraries

See [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml) for the specific libraries and versions you should use!
When making recommendations, make sure you are referencing the correct verions! Double check your work.

- FastAPI
- Pydantic 2.0+
- SQLAlchemy
- AsyncPG
- Alembic

# Rules

- Use best practices for FastAPI.
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
- Prefer async functions for all I/O operations.
- Use type hints for all function signatures.
- Use Pydantic v2 models for input validation and response schemas.
- Implement SQLAlchemy 2.0 with AsyncPG for database operations.
- Use Alembic for database migrations (configure this in a sibling folder called `/alembic`)
- Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data (e.g., using Redis).
- Use pytest for unit and integration testing (all python tests should be in a sibling folder called /tests)
- Use Ruff for linting and formatting Python code.
